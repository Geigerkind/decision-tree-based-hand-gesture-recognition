# Gestures
LR, RL, TB, BT and NotGestures.

## NotGestures
1. Going in and out on the same side. Here only from Top -> Bottom was recorded. Other directions can be inferred by rotation.
2. Going in from one side and out on a side 90Â° to it. Here only Top -> Right was recorded. Other directions can be inferred by rotation.
Note: Notgestures are split in the CSV by following line "1023,1023,1023,1023,1023,1023,1023,1023,1023,0"

## Distances
5, 10, 20, 25 cm

## Amount of gestures
Each gesture of each configuration was recorded exactly 100 times.

## FPS
The camera is limited by hardware to 90 FPS.

## Brightness levels
Low: The light is about 40 cm above the light sensors. I put a picture in the configuration.
    => Sample: 151,165,151,153,115,154,154,115,101
Medium: The light is about 40 cm above the light sensors. I put a picture in the configuration.
    => Sample: 665,686,667,679,614,668,695,646,615
High: A flashlight was used about 40cm above the light sensors. I put a picture in the configuration.
Note: The flashlight creates a pointy light source, making it vastly different from the previous light.
    => Sample: 894,906,908,909,910,911,913,914,909
