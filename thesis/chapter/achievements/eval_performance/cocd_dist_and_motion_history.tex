\subsection{Center of Gravity Distribution Float and Integer Ansatz}
Show graphs about:
Best solution,
Best feasible solution,
With and WithOUT considering null gestures.
Talk when it starts to generalize more poorly(?)

Here state what was expected and state how it worked out!
Talk about brightness distribution!!
 ==> Alternative approach => Stacking (?)
